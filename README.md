# guardian-qc
QC-Guardian is a tool that uses unsupervised machine learning to identify quality control outliers from metrics generated by common NGS QC tools, including FastQC, Picard, and bcftools. It was developed for somatic NGS testing, but may be applicable to other sequencing pipelines following appropriate validation.
